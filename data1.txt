Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized for her songwriting, musical versatility, artistic reinventions, and influence on the music industry, she is a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century.

Swift began songwriting professionally at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country musician. Under Big Machine, she released six studio albums, four of them to country radio, starting with her self-titled album (2006). Her next record, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) incorporated rock influences, and Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She forwent her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired her next album, the hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017), and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".

After signing a new contract with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released her seventh album, Lover (2019), and autobiographical documentary, Miss Americana (2020). She embraced indie folk and alternative rock on her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore and explored chill-out styles on Midnights (2022). The albums broke multifarious records, led by the respective number-one singles "Cardigan", "Willow", and "Anti-Hero". A dispute with Big Machine led Swift to re-record her first six albums, having launched three of them in 2021–2023 as "Taylor's Versions". Her "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" is the longest song to top the Hot 100. Swift has directed music videos and films such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021) and played supporting roles in others.

Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians, the most streamed woman on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. She has been featured in critical listicles such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100, and Forbes Celebrity 100. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; a Primetime Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 Billboard Music Awards; 12 Country Music Association Awards; three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards; and 98 Guinness World Records. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

Life and career
Early life

Swift's childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania
Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[3] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Her younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] She was named after singer-songwriter James Taylor,[6] and has Scottish,[7] German and Italian heritage.[8][9] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer.[10] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[11][12] Swift identifies as a Christian.[13] She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters,[14] before transferring to The Wyndcroft School.[15] The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[16] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[17] She spent her summers at the beach in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, and performed in a local coffee shop.[18][19]

At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[20] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[21] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything."[22] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[23][24] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[25] She traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[26] She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."[27]

When Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. "Kiss Me" by Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[28][29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift enter into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[11][34] Swift initially attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to the Aaron Academy after two years, which better suited her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36]

2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album
In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[37][38] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[39] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[40] Rose thought the sessions were "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[41] but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals may shelve artists,[33][24] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[42]

At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[44] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[45][46] She began working on her eponymous debut album with producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right "chemistry".[24] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[47] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[48] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her "honesty, intelligence and idealism".[49] The album peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, where it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. in the 2000s decade.[50] It made Swift the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a U.S. platinum-certified debut album.[51]

Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[52] As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[52] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[53] as a replacement for Eric Church.[54] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[52][11] Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song", and "Should've Said No" reaching number one. With "Our Song", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[55] "Teardrops on My Guitar" reached number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[56] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[57][58] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours throughout 2006–2007, including George Strait,[59] Brad Paisley,[60] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[61]

Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[62] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[63] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[64] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[65] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[66] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again,[67] and dated singer Joe Jonas for three months.[68][69]

Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[72] and in March 2009, in other markets.[73] Critics lauded Swift's honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[74] Five singles were released in 2008 through 2009: "Love Story", "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen", and "Fearless". "Love Story", the lead single, peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[56][75] It was the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart.[76] "You Belong with Me" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[77] and was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[78] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" topping the chart.[79] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009's top-selling album in the U.S.[80] The Fearless Tour, Swift's first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[81] Journey to Fearless, a three-part documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[82] Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[83]

In 2009, the music video for "You Belong with Me" was named Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards.[84] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[85] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention, and many Internet memes.[86] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[87] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[88] The album ranked number 99 on NPR's 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.[89] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for "Love Story" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called "Thug Story".[90] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and "White Horse" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[93]

Swift featured on John Mayer's single "Half of My Heart" and Boys Like Girls' single "Two Is Better Than One", the latter of which she co-wrote.[94][95] She co-wrote and recorded "Best Days of Your Life" with Kellie Pickler,[96] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack—"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier".[71] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single "Today Was a Fairytale", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[97][98] While shooting her film debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[99] In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode.[100] She hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host to write their own opening monologue.[101][102]

Prior to 1989's release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[159] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[160] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[161] The following day, Apple Inc. announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[162] and Swift agreed to let 1989 on the streaming service.[163] Swift's intellectual property rights holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to Swift and the 1989 era memes.[164] She then returned her entire catalog plus 1989 to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play and other digital streaming platforms in June 2017.[165] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[166] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[167] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A.

Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for damages from his loss of employment. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault for nominal damages of only one dollar.[183] The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift.[184]

After a one-year hiatus from public spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts[185] and released "Look What You Made Me Do" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[186] The single was Swift's first U.K. number-one single.[187] It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.S.[188] Reputation was released on November 10, 2017.[189] It incorporated a heavy electropop sound, along with hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences.[190] Reviewers praised Swift's mature artistry, but some denounced the themes of fame and gossip.[191] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies. Swift became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the U.S.[192] The album topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada,[193] and had sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide as of 2018.[194] It spawned three other international singles, including the U.S. top-five entry "...Ready for It?",[195] and two U.S. top-20 singles—"End Game" (featuring Ed Sheeran and rapper Future) and "Delicate".[157] Swift launched the short-lived The Swift Life mobile app for fans in late 2017.[196] Reputation was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019.[197] At the American Music Awards of 2018, Swift won four awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist.

Reputation was Swift's last album with Big Machine. In November 2018, she signed a new deal with the Universal Music Group; her subsequent releases were promoted by Republic Records. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[203] Vox called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was "far from assured" until Swift intervened.[204]

While promoting Lover, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine over the purchase of the masters of her back catalog.[214] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine only allowed her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under another contract, which she refused to do.[214][215] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020.[216] Besides music, she played Bombalurina in the movie adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song "Beautiful Ghosts".[217][218] Critics panned the film but praised Swift's performance.[219] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix that January.[220][221] Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group in February 2020 after her 16-year-old contract with Sony/ATV expired.[222]

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift released two surprise albums: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11, 2020.[223][224] Both explore indie folk and alternative rock with a more muted production compared to her previous upbeat pop songs.[225][226] Swift wrote and recorded the albums with producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner from the National.[227] Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced select songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[228] The albums garnered widespread critical acclaim. The Guardian and Vox opined that Folklore and Evermore emphasized Swift's work ethic and increased her artistic credibility.[229][230] Three singles supported each of the albums, catering the U.S. mainstream radio, country radio, and triple A radio. The singles, in that order, were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore.[231] Swift became the first artist to debut a U.S. number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore's "Cardigan" and Evermore's "Willow".[232] Folklore was 2020's best-selling album in the U.S. with 1.2 million copies.[233] It won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman to win the award thrice.[234] At the 2020 American Music Awards, Swift won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[235] She was 2020's highest-paid musician in the U.S., and the world's highest-paid solo musician.[236]

Swift on the Eras Tour (2023)
Following the masters dispute, Swift released two re-recorded albums—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version)—in April and November 2021, respectively; both of them debuted atop the Billboard 200,[237] with the former becoming the first re-recorded album ever to do so.[238] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by the three tracks: "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", "You All Over Me" with Maren Morris, and "Mr. Perfectly Fine",[239] the first of which made Swift the first act since Dolly Parton to have both the original and the re-recording of a single reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[240] The closing track of Red (Taylor's Version), "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)"—accompanied by the namesake short film directed by Swift—debuted atop the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart.[241] The film was met with critical acclaim for Swift's direction.[242] It won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year—Swift's record third win in the category—and the Grammy Award for Best Music Video.[243][244] Swift was the highest-paid female musician of 2021,[245] and both her 2020 albums and the re-recordings were ranked among the top 10 best-sellers of the year.[246] She was awarded the National Music Publishers' Association's Songwriter Icon Award among others.[247] "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)" and "This Love (Taylor's Version)" were released in 2021 and 2022,[248][249] followed by "All of the Girls You Loved Before", "If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version)", "Eyes Open (Taylor's Version)", and "Safe & Sound (Taylor's Version)" featuring Joy Williams and John Paul White in 2023.[250] Speak Now (Taylor's Version), the third album in the re-recording series, was released on July 7, 2023.[251][252]

Beyond her albums, Swift was featured on five songs in 2021–2023: "Renegade" and "Birch" by Big Red Machine,[253] a remix of Haim's "Gasoline"[254] and Sheeran's "The Joker and the Queen",[255] and "The Alcott" by the National.[256] She released "Carolina" as part of the soundtrack of the film Where the Crawdads Sing,[257] and had a bit part in the period comedy Amsterdam.[258] Searchlight Pictures announced a feature film written and directed by Swift.[259]

Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022.[260] She experimented with electronica[261] and chill-out music styles on it.[262] Rolling Stone critics dubbed the album an "instant classic".[263][264] Commercially, Billboard described the album as a blockbuster,[265] and CNBC called it Swift's biggest success yet.[266] Breaking records across all formats of music consumption,[267][268] Midnights and its lead single, "Anti-Hero", became Spotify's most-streamed album and song in one day with 185 million and 17.4 million plays,[269][270] and the US' best-selling album and digital song of 2022, respectively.[268] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 1.57 million units, marking Swift's fifth album to open with over one million sales. She tied Barbra Streisand for the most number-one albums among women (11), and became the first artist in history to monopolize the Hot 100's entire top 10.[267] "Lavender Haze" became the second single in November 2022 and "Karma" became the third, accompanied by a remix featuring American rapper Ice Spice in May 2023; both peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[271][272]

In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, which broke the record for most concert tickets ever sold in a single day;[267] however, Ticketmaster was widely castigated for its mishandling of the ticket sale, triggering government investigations into the company.[273] Media outlets noted that, with her 2020–2023 releases, Swift reached a new height of popularity. Music Business Worldwide described it as a "new stratosphere of global career success", while Rolling Stone said "Swift managed to become bigger than ever before".[274][275]

Artistry
Influences
One of Swift's earliest memories of music is listening to her grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[4] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own."[276] Swift said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[277] She also attributes her "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother.[278] Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[279] and was introduced to the genre listening to "the great female country artists" of the 1990s—Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[280][281] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[282] Hill was Swift's childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[283] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[284] Swift also explored the music of older country stars such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[23] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters,[114] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[285] and Lori McKenna.[11] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell, citing especially how Mitchell's autobiographical lyrics convey the deepest emotions: "I think [Blue] is my favorite because it explores somebody's soul so deeply."[286]

Swift has also been influenced by various pop and rock artists. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams,[287] the Rolling Stones,[288] Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models.[11][289] She likes Springsteen and the Stones for remaining musically relevant for a long time[290] and credits the Stones with being "a huge influence on my entire outlook on my career."[291] As she grows older, Swift aspires to be like Harris and prioritize music over fame.[292] Her synth-pop album 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[293][294] She has also cited Keith Urban's musical style[295] and Fall Out Boy's lyrics as major influences.[296]

Genres
"If there's one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it's that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk's newest raconteur."

—The Recording Academy, 2021[297]
Swift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[298][259] having been described as a "music chameleon".[299][300] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[301] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock.[302][303] After 2010, they observed that Swift's melodies are rooted in pop music, and the country music elements are limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang;[304][305] some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[306][307] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift's status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning the legitimate roots of country music in favor of crossover success in the mainstream pop market.[308][309] Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, "I leave the genre labeling to other people."[310]

Music journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver ... planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop".[311] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first "documented, official pop album".[312] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[313][314][315] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, "subdued and amorphous pop sound".[316][317] Although reviews of Swift's pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift's pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[318][319] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift's pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[320] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative styles like indie rock with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[321][322] Clash said her career "has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing", reaching a point at which "Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift", not defined by any genre.[323]

Voice
Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[324] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[325][326] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[327] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[328] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing "intimacy over power and nuance".[329] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[330]

Los Angeles Times remarked, Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow".[331] With Reputation, critics noted she was "learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own",[332] swapping her "signature" expressive vocals for "cool, conversational, detached" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[333][334][335] However, Alternative Press stated that her "evocative" vocal stylings are more pop-punk and emo.[336]

Reviews of Swift's later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[305][337][338] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[339][340][341] Pitchfork described her vocals on the albums as "versatile and expressive".[342] Music theory professor Alyssa Barna called Swift's timbre "breathy and bright" in the upper register and "full and dark" in the lower.[226] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and "fuller" tone of her voice.[343][344][345] An i review said Swift's voice is "leagues better now" with her newfound vocal furniture.[346] The Guardian highlighted "yo-yoing vocal yelps" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift's voice,[347] and that her country twang faded away.[348] Midnights received acclaim for Swift's nuanced vocal delivery.[349] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[326] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised Swift's "stronger" vocals, clarity and tone.[350]

Songwriting
Further information: List of songs by Taylor Swift
Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters of all time by several publications.[351][352][353] She told The New Yorker in 2011 that she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[11] Swift's personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[354][355] Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[356][357] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[358][359] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[360] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[293] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[361] and Lover detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love".[362] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[363][364] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[278][365]

Her confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics;[366][11][367] they highlighted its vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[368][369][370] Critics praised her melodic songwriting; Rolling Stone described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[371][372] NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics",[334] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures".[372] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[11] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[373][374][375] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[376]

On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[377] Without referencing her personal life, she imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[356] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[377] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on Evermore.[378] Consequence stated her 2020 albums provided a chance to convince skeptics of Swift had "songwriting power", noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult".[379]

Swift self-categorizes her songwriting into three types: "quill lyrics", referring to songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.[380] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most "emotionally vulnerable" song of the album.[381] Swift's bridges are often underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs,[382][379] earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from Time.[383] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today" than Swift.[384] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[385] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[267] Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You're Anything Like Me".[386]

Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[387][388] Swift is known for her ability to command a large audience, such as in a stadium.[389][390][391] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, Swift possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of "whether [Swift is] plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers".[392]

In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called her a "preternaturally skilled" performer with a vibrant stage presence: "[Swift] returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen."[393] In 2018, Stereogum's Chris DeVille wrote that her onstage persona emulates "classic rock deities".[394] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted Swift's "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour,[395] and I critic Ilana Kaplan called Swift's showmanship "unparalleled".[396]

Critics have likewise highlighted Swift's versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[397][398] Her concert productions have been noted for their Broadway theatricality,[399][400] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[401] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar,[402] acoustic guitar, piano,[403] and sometimes banjo and ukulele.[404][405] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances have been described as intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her storytelling-based lyrics and connection with fans.[350] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that the intimacy of Swift's acoustic performances remain "integral to her singer-songwriter origins".[406][403] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift "pop's most approachable superstar",[407] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[408]

Video and film
Further information: Taylor Swift videography
Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music making process.[409] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011[410] and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before.[411] In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes."[412]

From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement in the craft.[413] She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[414] Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[415]

Her production house, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with her 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[416] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch,[417] but also ventured into sole direction with the videos for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction), "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero" and "Bejeweled".[418] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[267] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[419] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as her filmmaking influences.[409]

Cultural status
Main article: Cultural impact of Taylor Swift

Swift at the 2010 Time 100 Gala
As one of the leading music artists of the 21st century, Swift has influenced the music industry in many aspects.[463] Publications describe Swift as a cultural "vitality" or zeitgeist,[464][465] with Billboard noting only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support, resulting in her wide impact.[466] Publications consider Swift's million-selling albums an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[467][468] Swift is the only artist in Luminate Data history to have five albums sell over a million copies in a week,[469] leading New York magazine to call her "the one bending the music industry to her will".[468] Swift is also regarded as a champion of independent record shops,[470][471] contributing to the 21st-century vinyl revival.[472][473] Variety dubbed Swift the "Queen of Stream" after she achieved multiple streaming feats.[474] Economist Alan Krueger devised his concept "rockonomics"—a microeconomic analysis of the music industry—using Swift, whom he considers an "economic genius".[475]

In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the "world's biggest pop star", and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns: "[Swift] falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends", leaving all the other artists such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, and Justin Bieber "all vying for second place".[311] According to CNN, Swift began the 2010s decade as a country star and ended it as an "all-time musical titan".[476] She was the most googled woman in 2019 and musician in 2022.[477][478]

Legacy
Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[479] having extended her success and fame beyond the U.S.,[311][479] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][52] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[480][311] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[481] her guitar performances contributed to the "Taylor Swift factor", a phenomenon to which upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[482][483] According to publications, Swift changed the contemporary music landscape "forever" with the genre transitions across her career, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[484] and her power "to pull any sound she wants into mainstream orbit".[485] Furthermore, in being personal and vulnerable in her lyrics, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later pop stars like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[486] Scholars have also highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift and her music in the 21st century.[487][488]

Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired an entire generation of singer-songwriters.[480][321][489] Journalists praise her ability to change industry practices, noting how her actions reformed policies of streaming platforms, prompted awareness of intellectual property among upcoming musicians,[490][491] and reshaped the concert ticketing model.[492] Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[493] Vox called her the "millennial Bruce Springsteen",[494] and The Times named her "the Bob Dylan of our age".[495] In recognition of her cultural impact, Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[496] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[497] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards.[435]

Swift is also a subject of academic study;[498] her artistry and fame are popular topics of scholarly media research.[298] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical contexts.[499][298] Her songs are studied by evolutionary psychologists and cultural analysts to understand the relationship between popular music and human mating strategies.[500][501] Entomologists named a millipede species Nannaria swiftae in her honor.[260]

Senior artists such as Carole King,[502] Paul McCartney,[503] Ringo Starr,[504] Billy Joel,[505] Mick Jagger,[506] Madonna,[507] Parton,[508] and Springsteen have praised Swift's musicianship.[509] King regards Swift her "professional grand daughter" and thanked Swift for "carrying the torch forward".[502] Springsteen called her a "tremendous" writer.[509] Starr and Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[505][504]

Public image
Swift's music, life and image are points of attention in the global celebrity culture.[298] She started as a teen idol,[510] and has become a dominant figure in popular culture,[511] often referred to as a pop icon.[313][512] Publications note her immense popularity and longevity as the kind of fame unwitnessed since the 20th century.[513][514] Music critics Sam Sanders and Ann Powers regard Swift as a "surprisingly successful composite of megawatt pop star and bedroom singer-songwriter."[515]

Journalists have written about Swift's polite and "open" personality,[36][45] calling her a "media darling" and "a reporter's dream".[366] Awarding her for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, former First Lady Michelle Obama described Swift as an artist who "has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish".[516] Swift was labeled by the media in her early career as "America's Sweetheart" for her likability and girl-next-door image.[517][518] YouGov surveys ranked her as the world's most admired female musician from 2019 to 2021.[519]

Though Swift is reluctant to publicly discuss her personal life, believing it to be "a career weakness",[520] it is a topic of widespread media attention and tabloid speculation,[521] with all her moves "closely monitored and analyzed."[465] Clash described Swift as a lightning rod for both praise and criticism.[522] The New York Times asserted in 2013 that her "dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash" and questioned whether she was in the midst of a "quarter-life crisis".[523] Critics have highlighted that Swift's life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and slut-shaming.[524][525] Glamour opined Swift is an easy target for male derision, triggering "fragile male egos".[526] The Daily Telegraph said her antennae for sexism are crucial for the industry.[527]

Swift is known for her love of cats. Her pet cats have been featured in her visual works,[528] and one of them is the third richest pet animal in the world, with an estimated net worth of $97 million.[529]

Entrepreneurship
Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman.[530][531] She is also known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable "multimedia bonanza".[532][533] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[534] Publications describe her discography as a music "universe" subject to analyses by fans, critics and journalists.[535][536][511] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[537][463][538]

Swift has endorsed many brands and businesses. In 2009, she launched a l.e.i. sundress range at Walmart,[539] and designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls.[540][541] Also that year, she became a spokesperson for the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras.[542][543] Swift launched two Elizabeth Arden fragrances—"Wonderstruck" and "Wonderstruck Enchanted",[544] followed by "Taylor" and its "Made of Starlight" variation in 2013,[545][546] and "Incredible Things" in 2014.[547] She signed a multi-year deal with AT&T in 2016 and bank corporation Capital One in 2019.[548][549] Swift released a sustainable clothing line with Stella McCartney in 2019.[550] In light of her philanthropic support for independent record stores during the COVID-19 pandemic, Record Store Day named Swift their first-ever global ambassador.[470]

Politics
Swift identifies as a pro-choice[551] feminist, and is one of the founding signatories of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment.[552] She criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade (1973) and end federal abortion rights in 2022.[553] Swift advocates for LGBT rights,[554] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[555][556] The New York Times wrote her 2011 music video for "Mean" had a positive impact on the LGBTQ+ community.[557] Swift performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument.[558] She has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[559][560]

A supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the U.S.,[561] Swift is a vocal critic of white supremacy, racism, and police brutality.[562][551] In 2020, she urged her fans to check their voter registration ahead of elections, which resulted in 65,000 people registering to vote within a day after her post,[563] and then endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election.[564] Following the George Floyd protests, she donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter movement,[565] called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee,[566] and advocated for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.[567]

Wealth and philanthropy
Swift's net worth is $740 million, per an estimate by Forbes in June 2023, making her the richest female musician in U.S. history with music as the only main source of income.[568] Additionally, her publication rights over her first six albums are valued at $200 million in 2022.[569] Forbes has named her the annual top-earning female musician four times (2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022).[570] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by the Guinness World Records as the highest annual earnings ever for a female musician,[571] which she herself surpassed with $185 million in 2019.[572] Overall, Swift was the highest paid female artist of the 2010s decade, earning $825 million.[573] She has also invested in a real estate portfolio worth $150 million as of 2023; it includes a Greek Revival mansion and an industrial style penthouse in Nashville; the Samuel Goldwyn Estate in Beverly Hills, California; the High Watch in Watch Hill, Rhode Island; and a townhouse, two penthouses (later merged), and a condo floor in Tribeca, Manhattan,[574] nicknamed as "Taybeca" by local realtors.[575]

Swift is well-known for her philanthropic efforts.[576] She was ranked at number one on DoSomething's "Gone Good" list,[577] and has received the "Star of Compassion" accolade from the Tennessee Disaster Services,[578] The Big Help Award from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her "dedication to helping others" as well as "inspiring others through action".[579] In 2008, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood.[580] In 2009, she sang at BBC's Children in Need concert and raised £13,000 for the cause.[581] Swift has performed at charity relief events, including Sydney's Sound Relief concert.[582] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV.[583] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the U.S., raising more than $750,000.[584] In 2016, she donated $1 million to Louisiana flood relief efforts and $100,000 to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[585][586] Swift donated to food banks after Hurricane Harvey struck Houston in 2017,[587] to at every stop of the Eras Tour in 2023; she also made mass purchases from various local businesses throughout the tour.[588][589] In 2020, Swift donated $1 million for Tennessee tornado relief.[590]

She is also a supporter of the arts. A benefactor of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame,[591] Swift has donated $75,000 to Nashville's Hendersonville High School to help refurbish the school auditorium,[592] $4 million to fund the building of a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville,[593] $60,000 to the music departments of six U.S. colleges,[594] and $100,000 to the Nashville Symphony.[595] Also a promoter of children's literacy, she has donated money and books to various schools around the country to improve education.[596][597] In 2007, Swift partnered with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police to launch a campaign to protect children from online predators.[598] She has donated items to several charities for auction, including the UNICEF Tap Project and MusiCares.[599] As recipient of the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in 2011, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee.[600] In 2012, Swift participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing the charity single "Ronan", which she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma.[601] She has also donated $100,000 to the V Foundation for Cancer Research[602] and $50,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[603] Swift has encouraged young people to volunteer in their local communities as part of Global Youth Service Day.[604]
